Explanation
Iterate through each character: Traverse each character of the string str.
Replace characters: For each character:
If it matches ch1, append ch2 to the result string.
If it matches ch2, append ch1 to the result string.
If it doesn't match either, append the character itself to the result string.
Build the result string: Collect all the characters into a new string that reflects the replacements.
